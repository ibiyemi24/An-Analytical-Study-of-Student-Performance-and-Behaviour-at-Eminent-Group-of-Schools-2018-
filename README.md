**An Analytical Study of Student Performance and Behaviour at Eminent Group of Schools (2018)**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzed student performance and behaviour data from the Eminent Group of Schools (2018) using an interactive Excel-based dashboard. The goal was to uncover key academic, behavioural, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing student outcomes and to support data-driven academic and operational decision-making.
The study leveraged 113,006 records across 23 variables, including attendance, grades, project scores, extracurricular activities, stress levels, family income, parental education, and internet access at home.

**Methodology**

•**	**Data Source**:** Kaggle (public educational dataset)

•	**Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, KPI Cards, Slicers)

•	**Pre-processing**: Data cleaning, validation, standardization, and variable classification

•	**Analysis Approach:**
o	Descriptive and comparative analysis
o	Correlation-based analysis (non-causal)
o	Departmental, demographic, and socioeconomic segmentation

•	**Visualization Techniques**: Bar charts, column charts, line charts, donut charts, pie charts, and KPI cards

**Key Discoveries**

•	Computer Science (CS) emerged as the top-performing department, leading in:
o	Attendance (1,822)
o	Grades (2,022)
o	Project scores (151,466.99)
o	Extracurricular participation (2,022)
•	Mathematics consistently recorded the lowest attendance (439), engagement, and academic outcomes.

•	Students with internet access at home achieved dramatically higher final scores
(311,982.22 vs 36,221.72).

•	Medium-income students achieved the highest cumulative final scores
(138,291.95), outperforming high-income groups.

•	Male students slightly outperformed female students
(177,786.06 vs 170,417.88), though the gap was minimal.

•	High-performing departments (CS and Engineering) also showed the highest stress levels
(CS: 11,122).

**Identified Problems**

•	Low attendance and engagement in the Mathematics department.

•	Unequal academic outcomes linked to internet access and income levels.

•	High stress levels in top-performing departments.

•	Underutilization of extracurricular activities in non-CS departments.

•	Limited institutional mechanisms to translate best-performing practices across departments.

**Insights & Recommendations**

•	Replicate CS best practices across departments to improve performance consistency.

•	Target Mathematics and Business departments with enhanced academic support and engagement strategies.

•	Expand extracurricular programs, as participation strongly correlates with higher academic performance.

•	Invest in digital access, including subsidized internet and on-campus learning hubs.

•	Implement stress management initiatives in high-performing departments.

•	Introduce equity-focused support, especially for female students and those from lower-income backgrounds.

**Impact**

•	Enables evidence-based academic planning and resource allocation.

•	Supports academic excellence and positive student behaviour.

•	Highlights digital access as a critical success factor in modern education.

•	Provides a scalable analytics framework for future institutional monitoring.

•	Lays the foundation for predictive analytics and early intervention strategies.

**In Summary**

This project demonstrates how educational analytics and dashboards can transform raw academic data into actionable insights. While the Computer Science department sets a benchmark for performance, the findings emphasize the importance of balanced support systems, digital equity, and student wellbeing to achieve sustainable academic success across all departments.
